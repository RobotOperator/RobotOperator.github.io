## My Work in Computer Science at SNHU

This portfolio contains projects that I developed and enhanced during my academic journey at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). As the final part of my learning program I chose to enahnce the below included projects as a demonstration of my ability to:

  1. Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
  2. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts 
  3. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices (data structures and algorithms) 
  4. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software engineering/design/database) 
  5. Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources
  
This portfolio demonstrates a great many skills that I gained through my studies as SNHU through publicly shared projects incorporating Python, PHP, Java, MongoDB, and SQLite. If you have an interest in learning a bit more about my development capabilities please feel free to reach out to me directly about some of my private projects featuring C#, Python, PowerShell, Bash, C++, and more.

## 3. [Grazioso Dashboard](https://www.google.com)
I have chosen to improve the Grazioso Dashboard that I created in CS340 Client Server Development at SNHU. This dashboard was developed as a full stack project with a MongoDB backend, Python middleware module that performed CRUD actions with database, and a Jupyter Notebook web front end that presented animal records to users as well as a graph and map relating to records presented. The initial version of this project is available in my code repositories [here](https://www.google.com) This project presents a great example of my abilities to create full-stack software solutions.

I chose to to improve this project by re-implementing the client front-end and middleware functionality for interacting with the database in PHP as well as adding required user authentication to access the data in the dashboard. Re-implementing this project in PHP makes it far more versatile for deployment across a wide range of well supported webservers like Apache, NGinx, and IIS. Throughout the process of enhancing this project I learned a great deal about PHP function calls, AJAX JQL queries, and authenticated session tracking for web servers. Many of the cleint side rendered functionality of this project was initially handled transparently by Python Dash modules which I discovered to not be avaialbe in PHP. This offered me the opportunity to both learn more about client side web technologies like javascript and more accurately control the client side content rendered for the dashboard of this project. One of the benefits of this was that I found I cou
